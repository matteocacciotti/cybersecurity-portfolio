# Offensive Scripting

This section contains custom offensive or automation scripts
written in **Bash**, **C**, and **Python**, developed as part of my red teaming journey.

The focus is on:
- Networking utilities
- Enumeration and exploitation automation
- File handling and process control
- CLI tooling for red team tasks

Each script will be documented and tested in isolated folders.
