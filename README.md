# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Red Teaming Portfolio

Welcome! This is the personal cybersecurity learning repository of **Matteo Cacciotti**, focused on **Red Teaming**, offensive security, and hands-on technical development.

## 📌 On AI Assistance

To ensure full transparency:

> 🧠 All technical content, notes, scripts, and exercises are my own —
> based on personal study, practical labs, and certifications.

> 🤖 I used AI tools solely to support:
> - Organizing the overall structure of this repository
> - Improving clarity, formatting, and readability of notes
> - Editing content for clean publication and professional presentation

This repository reflects my real effort and growth. AI was a tool to **enhance structure and polish**, not to substitute learning or original work.
