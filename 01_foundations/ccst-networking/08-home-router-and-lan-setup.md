# 08 – Home Router & LAN Technologies

## Key Components in a Home Network

- **WLAN (Wireless LAN)** → Wireless local network
- **Network Switch** → Connects devices in a LAN via Ethernet
- **Router** → Manages the local network and provides internet access
- **Modem** → Connects the local network to the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** → Automatically assigns IP addresses
- **IP Address** → Uniquely identifies each node in the network

> ⚠️ The **modem** connects to the external ISP network, while the **router** creates and manages the internal LAN/Wi-Fi.

## Router Ports

- **Ethernet Ports** → For wired devices; share the same local network
- **Internet/WAN Port** → Connects to the modem via coaxial or DSL cable

## Wireless Frequencies and Protocols

- **2.4 GHz** → Greater coverage, lower speed
- **5 GHz** → Lower coverage, higher speed
- **IEEE 802.11** → Wi-Fi standard (e.g., a/b/g/n/ac/ax)
- **SSID (Service Set Identifier)** → Public name of the WLAN
- **SSID Broadcasting** → Can be disabled for security

> ⚠️ If a device doesn’t support the latest 802.11 standard, the router can be set to **legacy/mixed mode**.

## Wired Network: Ethernet and Cable Types

- **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)** → Standard for wired LAN connections
- **Category 5e (Cat5e)** → 4 twisted wire pairs to reduce interference
- **Coaxial Cable** → Used for modem connections
- **Optical Fiber** → Very high speed and long range, ideal for backbones and ISPs

## Other Key Terms

- **Frame** → Basic unit of data transmission in a network
- **STA (Wireless Station)** → Any client connected to a WLAN
- **Wi-Fi Channel** → Defines the specific frequency the network operates on

> 🎯 Optimizing Wi-Fi settings (channel, mode, security) is crucial for performance and hardening.
