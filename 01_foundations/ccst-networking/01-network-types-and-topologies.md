# Network Types

Understanding network types is fundamental in offensive cybersecurity, as the scope and scale of a network directly affect how vulnerabilities propagate and are exploited.

## Classification by Scale

- **Personal/Home Networks**
  Designed for a small number of connected devices (e.g., PCs, printers, smart home devices). These networks often lack complex segmentation or security policies.

- **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Networks**
  Connect a limited number of devices, typically with minimal IT support. Security often relies on default hardware configurations â€” a common attack vector.

- **Enterprise Networks**
  Cover medium to large infrastructures with hundreds or thousands of hosts across multiple geographic locations. Use structured segmentation, VLANs, and policy-based routing.

- **Global Networks**
  Interconnected systems spanning the globe (e.g., the Internet). Attack surfaces multiply due to the sheer number of entry points and interconnected systems.
