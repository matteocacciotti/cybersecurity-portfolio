# Data Transmission

Understanding how data moves through a network is crucial when analyzing traffic or crafting payloads in offensive security.

## Data Types

- **Volunteered Data**
  Actively provided by users (e.g., input into forms or logins).

- **Observed Data**
  Collected passively from sensors or traffic monitoring.

- **Inferred Data**
  Derived from user behavior or metadata.

## Digital Representation

- **Bit (Binary Digit)** → Smallest unit of data: `0` or `1`.
- **Byte** → 8 bits.
- **ASCII** → Maps characters to 8-bit binary codes (e.g., `A` = 01000001).

## Transmission Lifecycle

1. Input: Data is digitized into binary
2. Encoding: Translated into signals (electrical, optical, or RF)
3. Transmission: Sent over physical or wireless media to a destination
