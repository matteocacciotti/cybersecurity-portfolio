## Twisted Pair (Copper)

**UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**
- Types: CAT5e, CAT6
- Max speed: 1 Gbps (CAT5e), 10 Gbps (CAT6)
- Max length: 100 meters
> Common in LAN environments

**STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**
- Like UTP but with extra shielding
- Better protection from interference
- Requires proper grounding
> Used in electrically noisy environments

---

## Coaxial Cable

- Previously used in Ethernet and cable networks
- Now mostly obsolete in modern LANs
- Can still be found in specific setups

---

## Fiber Optic

- Uses light to transmit data
- Supports high speeds and long distances
- Immune to electromagnetic interference
> Ideal for backbone and data center connections

---

## Wireless

- No physical cable; uses radio signals
- Speed and range depend on Wi-Fi standard (e.g., Wi-Fi 4/5/6)
- Supports mobility and flexible deployment
> Common in homes, offices, and public areas

## Choosing the Right Medium

When selecting a transmission medium, consider:

- **Distance** the signal must travel
- **Bandwidth** or speed requirements
- **Environment**: indoor, outdoor, interference
- **Cost**: materials and installation

## Abbreviations

- **UTP** – Unshielded Twisted Pair
- **STP** – Shielded Twisted Pair
