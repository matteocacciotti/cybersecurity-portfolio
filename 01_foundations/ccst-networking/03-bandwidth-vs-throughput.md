# Bandwidth vs Throughput

These metrics determine the performance and responsiveness of a network — factors that influence both defense and attack strategies.

## Bandwidth (Theoretical Limit)

- Represents maximum data capacity of a connection.
- Measured in:
  - **Kbps** (Kilobits per second)
  - **Mbps** (Megabits per second)
  - **Gbps** (Gigabits per second)
  - **Tbps** (Terabits per second)

## Throughput (Actual Performance)

- The real amount of data transferred over time.
- Affected by:
  - **Latency** → Delay in data travel
  - **Congestion** → Competing traffic
  - **Packet loss** → Data dropped due to errors or overload
